There was only one change between my wireframe and my website, and that change was adding in a section underneath the original information section. I added this because the original “about me” section wasn’t allowed to use the full width of the screen (it was sharing width with the “contact me” and the “download resume”), so it wouldn’t show something in paragraph format well. Adding in the new section was super easy, as I just made a new div underneath the “info” div and gave it an existing class with the style rules I wanted. Everything else is exactly how I envisioned it because I’m perfect and html is easy.
