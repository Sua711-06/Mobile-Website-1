One change was adding in a section underneath the original information section. I added this because the original “about me” section wasn’t allowed to use the full width of the screen (it was sharing width with the “contact me” and the “download resume”), so it wouldn’t show something in paragraph format well. Adding in the new section was super easy, as I just made a new div underneath the “info” div and gave it an existing class with the style rules I wanted. I also removed the search bar because it was useless. lastly, I made it so on really teeny tiny screens the info sections just line up in a straight column, due to lack of screen width to read side by side sections.
